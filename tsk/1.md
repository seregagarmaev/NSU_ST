# Task List 1. Streaming Data Processing

## Inputs

1. All input files are located at the data directory `~/dst/d/` this is the default data directory
2. The result format:

 - all tasks are made with `*.sh`-scripts inside `~/dst/src/` directory;
 - for the tasks list a folder is created, according to a task list id
 (ex: this task list id is 1, so there should be the corresponding folder `~/dst/src/1`)
  and all solutions should be placed in it.
 - The solutions should be named according to the task number. Ex: `1.1.1.sh`

## 1. Level 1: All tasks should be accomplished

1.1.1. Use `curl` to download the files:

```
http://data.gov.ru/sites/default/files/opendata/7107542055-ioszpro/data-2015-03-11T00-00-00-structure-2015-03-11T00-00-00.csv
https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads2013n_ASCII.zip
```

1.1.2. Use `tar` or `unzip` to extract the downloaded file.

1.1.3. Use `tail` to get 10 last lines of `l1.log`.

1.1.4. Use `head` to get 5 first lines of `l1.log`.

1.1.5. Use `split` to divide `l1.log` by 4 files. First create folder `d/log/l1` with `mkdir`.
and then use `split` to put parts of the file into it.

1.1.6. Use `wc` to count words in `l1.log`.

1.1.7. Use `wc` to count lines in `l1.log`.

1.1.8. Use `src/csv-to-tree.awk` to build a tree in the `dot`-format from `tre.csv`.

1.1.9. Use `dot` & `eog`. Use piping to cache intermediate results to FS.

## 2. Level 2: One of the tasks should be accomplished

1.2.1. Use `jq` to extract relation graph from `friends.json`, save it in `dot`-format and visualize.

1.2.2. Use `jq` to extract interests graph from `friends.json`, save it in `dot`-format and visualize.
